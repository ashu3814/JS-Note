# JavaScript Object Methods and `this`

## 🚀 Introduction
JavaScript objects represent real-world entities like users, orders, or products. These objects can not only store data but also perform actions using functions, known as **methods**.

Let’s dive into the world of object methods, explore how `this` behaves, and clarify these concepts with clear code, real-life analogies, and visual aids.

## 🧠 What Are Object Methods?
An **object method** is a function stored as a property of an object. Methods define the behavior of an object.

### 👨‍💼 Real-Life Analogy:
Imagine an object `employee` with actions like `clockIn()` and `clockOut()`. These actions (methods) make the employee functional, not just a data holder.

### 📦 Example:
```js
let user = {
  name: "Alice",
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello!");
  }
};

user.greet(); // Output: Hello!
````

## ✨ Method Shorthand Syntax

JavaScript allows a cleaner syntax for defining methods:

```js
let car = {
  start() {
    console.log("Engine started.");
  }
};

car.start(); // Engine started.
```

## 🔍 Understanding `this`

The `this` keyword refers to the **object that is executing the current method**.

### 🎯 Real-Life Example:

A `remoteControl` object has a method `pressButton()` that logs the brand of the remote.

```js
let remoteControl = {
  brand: "Sony",
  pressButton() {
    console.log(`Button pressed on ${this.brand}`);
  }
};

remoteControl.pressButton(); // Button pressed on Sony
```

### ❌ Common Mistake:

Accessing the object directly by name instead of using `this` can lead to bugs:

```js
let remoteControl = {
  brand: "Sony",
  pressButton() {
    console.log(`Button pressed on ${remoteControl.brand}`);
  }
};

let another = remoteControl;
remoteControl = null;
another.pressButton(); // ❌ Error
```

### ✅ Using `this` avoids that:

```js
let remoteControl = {
  brand: "Sony",
  pressButton() {
    console.log(`Button pressed on ${this.brand}`);
  }
};

let another = remoteControl;
remoteControl = null;
another.pressButton(); // ✅ Button pressed on Sony
```

## 🌐 `this` in Global Context

Outside of any object or in standalone functions, `this` behaves differently.

```js
function showThis() {
  console.log(this);
}

showThis(); // In strict mode: undefined; otherwise: window (global object)
```

---

## 🔁 Sharing Functions Between Objects

```js
function sayName() {
  console.log(this.name);
}

let user = { name: "John", say: sayName };
let admin = { name: "Admin", say: sayName };

user.say(); // John
admin.say(); // Admin
```

---

## 🏹 Arrow Functions and `this`

Arrow functions do **not** have their own `this`. Instead, they capture `this` from their surrounding lexical context.

### 📌 Example:

```js
let user = {
  firstName: "Ilya",
  sayHi() {
    let arrow = () => console.log(this.firstName);
    arrow();
  }
};

user.sayHi(); // Ilya
```

## 🧾 Summary

| Feature               | Behavior                                            |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Object Method         | Function stored in object property                  |
| `this` inside Method  | Refers to the object calling the method             |
| Global `this`         | `undefined` in strict mode, `window` in sloppy mode |
| Arrow Function `this` | Lexically inherited from outer function             |
