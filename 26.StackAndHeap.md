# üìö Stack and Heap Memory in JavaScript

Understanding memory management in JavaScript is important for writing efficient and bug-free code. JavaScript uses two main memory areas: **Stack** and **Heap**.

## üß± Stack Memory

### What is Stack?

- Stack is a region in memory used for **storing static data** like:
  - Primitive values (number, string, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint)
  - Function calls (execution context)
- It's **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** based ‚Äì the last thing added is the first removed.

### Characteristics:

- Fixed size
- Fast access
- Automatically managed (pushed and popped during function calls)

### Example:

```js
function greet() {
  let name = 'Alice'; // primitive value stored in stack
  console.log(name);
}

greet();
````

Here:

* `name = 'Alice'` is a primitive ‚Üí stored in the **stack**
* When `greet()` is called, a new **execution context** is pushed to the stack.
* Once completed, it's popped off.

## üß† Heap Memory

### What is Heap?

* Heap is a region in memory used for **storing dynamic data** like:

  * Objects
  * Arrays
  * Functions (as objects)
* It‚Äôs **unstructured** and has **no fixed access order**.

### Characteristics:

* Flexible size (larger than stack)
* Slower access compared to stack
* Managed via garbage collection (automatically)

### Example:

```js
function createUser() {
  const user = {
    name: 'Bob',
    age: 25
  }; // object stored in heap, reference in stack
  return user;
}

const newUser = createUser();
```

Here:

* The `user` object is created in the **heap**
* The reference to that object is stored in the **stack**
* `newUser` gets the same reference

## üìå Stack vs Heap Summary

| Feature      | Stack                  | Heap                       |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Type of data | Primitives, references | Objects, arrays, functions |
| Access speed | Very fast              | Slower                     |
| Order        | LIFO                   | No specific order          |
| Size         | Small                  | Large                      |
| Management   | Auto by JS engine      | Auto via Garbage Collector |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes

* Confusing value vs reference:

  * Changing a reference affects the original (heap)
  * Changing a primitive creates a copy (stack)

```js
let a = 10;
let b = a;
b = 20;
console.log(a); // 10

let obj1 = { value: 5 };
let obj2 = obj1;
obj2.value = 99;
console.log(obj1.value); // 99
```

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

* Use primitives when possible for better performance
* Avoid unnecessary object creation
* Be careful with reference sharing
* Use `Object.freeze()` or cloning if immutability is needed

---

## üîö Conclusion

* Stack = fast, small, for primitives and function calls.
* Heap = flexible, large, for dynamic objects.
* Knowing the difference helps in understanding how data behaves, memory leaks, and performance tuning.
